#### Questions  

1. What is the current tech stack for your application/product?
   - What is the state situation? Global? Redux? Zustand? Localstorage?
   - I want to research anything that I have not had direct experience with, so I can ramp up and be quick to onboard on my own free time.
2. What is the team size, and what does the workflow look like?

   - Jira/bugs/tickets/tasks/stories?
   - Where do feature requests come from?
   - Is there a design team? Creative lead? Product manager?
   - Sprint length? How do deliverables work? Planned releases vs incremental?

3. How can I have the biggest impact right away? (What needs the most help)
